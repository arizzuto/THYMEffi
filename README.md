# THYMEffi
Code to make FFI light curves, with background correction and dynamically sized apertures from TESS full frame images for the TESS Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME) team and others.

Setup and usage is described in the scripts, but feel free to ask Aaron Rizzuto for help at any time. 

Adapted from Aaron Rizzuto's development repository, will be updated as important changes happen.
Does not include the Notch filter pipeline, though the lightcurves produced from this are compatible with those codes (see https://bitbucket.org/aaronrizzuto/detrend-k2 for that)
